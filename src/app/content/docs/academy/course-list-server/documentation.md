# CourseListServer Documentation (`src/app/academy/CourseListServer.tsx`)

## Overview

The `CourseListServer` (`src/app/academy/CourseListServer.tsx`) component fetches and displays a list of courses from an API endpoint. It is a server component, meaning it fetches the data on the server before rendering the component. The `CourseList` component is wrapped in an `ErrorBoundary` to handle errors.

## Functionality

- **Fetches Courses from API:** Fetches a list of courses from the API endpoint defined in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable.
- **Displays Course List:** Renders a list of courses using the `CourseList` component.

## Technical Details

- The component is a server component, meaning it fetches the data on the server before rendering the component.
- The component uses the `cachedFetch` function to make the API request.
- The component dynamically constructs the base URL for the API endpoint based on the environment (development or production). In development, it uses `http://localhost:3000`, and in production, it uses `https://wescode.vercel.app`.

## Components

- `CourseListServer`: The main component that fetches and displays the list of courses.
- `CourseList`: A component that renders the list of courses.

## Data Flow

1.  The `CourseListServer` component is rendered.
2.  The component calls the `fetchCourses` function to fetch the list of courses from the API endpoint.
3.  The `fetchCourses` function makes an API request to the endpoint defined in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable.
4.  The API returns a list of courses.
5.  The `CourseListServer` component then renders the `CourseList` component within an `ErrorBoundary`, passing the list of courses as the `courses` prop.
6.  The `CourseList` component renders a list of courses, displaying the title, description, duration, and level of each course.
