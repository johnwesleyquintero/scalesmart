# Sitemap Documentation (`src/app/sitemap.ts`)

## Overview

The Sitemap (`src/app/sitemap.ts`) defines the sitemap for the application, which is a list of all the pages on the site that search engine crawlers can use to index the site. It helps search engines discover and crawl the site more efficiently.

## Functionality

- **Defines Sitemap Entries:** Lists the URLs of the pages on the site, along with their last modified date, change frequency, and priority.
- **Specifies Base URL:** Defines the base URL for the site.
- **Dynamically Adds Blog Posts:** Allows blog posts to be dynamically added to the sitemap based on the content.

## Technical Details

- The file uses the `MetadataRoute` type from `next`.
- The `dynamic = 'force-static'` directive forces the sitemap to be generated statically at build time.
- The `lastModified` property specifies the date the page was last modified.
- The `changeFrequency` property specifies how often the page is likely to change.
- The `priority` property specifies the importance of the page relative to other pages on the site.

## Data Flow

1.  The `sitemap` function is exported from the `src/app/sitemap.ts` file.
2.  The function returns an array of sitemap entries, each containing the URL, last modified date, change frequency, and priority of a page on the site.
3.  Search engine crawlers can then access the sitemap to discover and crawl the site more efficiently.
