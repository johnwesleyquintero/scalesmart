# Loading Page Documentation (`src/app/loading.tsx`)

## Overview

The Loading Page (`src/app/loading.tsx`) is displayed while the application is loading. It provides a visual indicator to the user that the application is in the process of loading.

## Functionality

- **Displays Loading Indicator:** Shows a spinning loader icon to indicate that the application is loading.
- **Displays Loading Message:** Shows a "Loading..." message to provide additional context to the user.

## Technical Details

- The page is a client-side component.
- It uses the `Loader2` icon from the `lucide-react` library.
- It uses a gradient background for visual appeal.

## Components

- `Loading`: The main loading page component.

## Data Flow

1.  When a page is loading, the `Loading` component is rendered.
