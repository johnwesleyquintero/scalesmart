# Chat API Endpoint Documentation (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`)

## Overview

The `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` file defines an API endpoint that handles chat requests using the Google Gemini AI model. It retrieves a message from the request body, constructs a context-aware prompt, sends the prompt to the Gemini model, and returns the response. It also implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Functionality

- **Handles Chat Requests:** Receives chat requests from the client.
- **Implements Rate Limiting:** Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Constructs Context-Aware Prompt:** Constructs a context-aware prompt that includes portfolio information and previous conversation history.
- **Sends Prompt to Gemini AI Model:** Sends the prompt to the Google Gemini AI model.
- **Returns AI Response:** Returns the response from the Gemini AI model as a JSON response.
- **Includes Improved Error Handling:** Includes improved error handling, logging detailed error information.

## Technical Details

- The endpoint uses the `rateLimiter` from `@/lib/api/rate-limiter` to implement rate limiting.
- The endpoint uses the `GoogleGenerativeAI` from `@google/generative-ai` to interact with the Gemini AI model.
- The endpoint uses environment variables to store the Gemini API key.
- The endpoint loads portfolio context from a JSON file.

## Data Flow

1.  A POST request is made to the `/api/chat` endpoint with the user's message and conversation history.
2.  The endpoint implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.
3.  The endpoint constructs a context-aware prompt that includes portfolio information and previous conversation history.
4.  The endpoint sends the prompt to the Google Gemini AI model.
5.  The endpoint returns the response from the Gemini AI model as a JSON response.
