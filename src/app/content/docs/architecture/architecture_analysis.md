# Architecture Analysis

This document describes the architectural changes introduced in recent updates to the codebase.

## src/actions/keywordActions.ts

This file has been updated to improve error handling and address a unique constraint violation. The `addProhibitedKeyword` function now includes more robust error handling, specifically catching database-related errors and providing more informative error messages. It also handles unique constraint violations (when a keyword already exists) by returning a user-friendly message. These changes enhance the reliability and user experience of the keyword management functionality.

## src/app/page.tsx

This file has been updated to improve the loading experience of the application's main page. It utilizes the `next/dynamic` import with a `loading` component for various sections. This approach allows for lazy loading of components, preventing the entire page from blocking while individual components are loaded, resulting in a smoother and more responsive user interface.

## src/components/ui/button.tsx

The `Button` component has been updated to allow it to be rendered as a different element, such as a `Link` from `react-router-dom`. This is achieved using the `asChild` prop and the `Slot` component from `@radix-ui/react-slot`. This change provides greater flexibility in how the button can be used within the application, allowing for more versatile integration with other components and libraries.

## src/lib/utils.ts

This file has been updated to remove leading and trailing hyphens from the generated slugs. This ensures that the generated slugs are cleaner, more consistent, and adhere to best practices for URL structures.

## src/lib/workflow/engine.ts

This file has been updated to include a node registry. This change introduces a mechanism for registering and managing different node types within the workflow engine. This enhances the engine's extensibility and maintainability, making it easier to add new node types and customize the workflow behavior.

## src/middleware.ts

This file has been updated to improve error handling within the middleware. Specifically, it addresses token expiration and other authentication errors. When a token expires or an authentication error occurs, the user is redirected to an appropriate page (e.g., the sign-in page or an error page), providing a better user experience and more graceful handling of authentication failures.
